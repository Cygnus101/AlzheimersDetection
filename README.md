## Code and Model Access

This project is organized into multiple Jupyter notebooks, each targeting a specific dataset and experimental setup:

- **`Alzheimers_v3.ipynb`**  
  Implements and evaluates models on the **OASIS** dataset, including Baseline CNN, Stacked CNN, and ResNet50.

- **`Alzheimers_v5.ipynb`**  
  Focuses on the **ADNI** dataset, applying the same set of architectures with additional data augmentation and preprocessing strategies.

### ðŸ”— Model Repositories

The trained models and associated checkpoints are hosted on Hugging Face and can be accessed using the following commands:

- **OASIS Models and Checkpoints**
  ```bash
  git clone https://huggingface.co/RajathRajesh12/Alzheimers1

- **Augmented ADNI Models and Checkpoints**
  ```bash
  git clone https://huggingface.co/RajathRajesh12/Alzheimers1
